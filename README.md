# Theosaurus-Rex's Advent of Code - Elixir Solutions

A collection of solutions written with Elixir for multiple years' worth of AoC challenges.

Some things to note:

- **There will be spoilers for puzzles from both past years and the current year**. Peruse at your own discretion.
- 2022 will be my first time participating in the challenge - as such, all previous years' solutions are completed outside of the month of their creation solely for my own entertainment and upskilling.
- Despite being an Elixir dev, I'm not necessarily skilled at solving code challenges. Steal these solutions at your own peril I guess, i'm not your dad 🤷
